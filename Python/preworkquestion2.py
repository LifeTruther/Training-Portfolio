# Question 2:
start, end = 0,200
for num in range(start,end):
    if num % 2 !=0:
        print(num)
# Result from terminal: a list of 100 odd numbers aligned vertically (sometimes they are just stuck together? I could add a space in the output...)
#I'm a little intimidated by the immediate complexities that this kind of problem inroduces...
